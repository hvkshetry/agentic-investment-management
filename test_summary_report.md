- **Resolution**: Real market data via yfinance
- **Test Result**: Correlations verified < 0.995

### Statistical Robustness ✅
- **Issue**: Basic sample covariance, ill-conditioned matrices
- **Resolution**: Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage implemented
- **Test Result**: Condition numbers improved, shrinkage available

### Risk Measures ✅
- **Issue**: Basic VaR only
- **Resolution**: 13+ risk measures via Riskfolio-Lib
- **Test Result**: CVaR, EVaR, MDR, UCI all available

### Tax Accuracy ✅
- **Issue**: Missing NIIT, trust taxes, MA specifics
- **Resolution**: Full implementation of all tax components
- **Test Result**: NIIT triggers at correct thresholds, trust brackets compressed, MA 12% STCG

### Confidence Scoring ✅
- **Issue**: No confidence metrics
- **Resolution**: Comprehensive scoring framework
- **Test Result**: All endpoints return confidence with warnings

## Coverage Areas

1. **Real Market Data**: No synthetic data anywhere
2. **Robust Statistics**: Ledoit-Wolf throughout
3. **Advanced Risk**: 13+ risk measures implemented
4. **Tax Completeness**: NIIT, trust, state-specific
5. **Professional Libraries**: Institutional-grade tools
6. **Confidence Scoring**: Every response includes metrics

## Known Issues

1. **OpenBB Compatibility**: Temporary issue with OpenBB/yfinance session handling
