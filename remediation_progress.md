# MCP Financial Servers Remediation Progress

## Status: Week 1 Implementation In Progress

### Completed Items âœ…

1. **Data Pipeline Module** (`shared/data_pipeline.py`)
   - OpenBB integration with fallback to yfinance
   - Real-time market data fetching
   - Data quality scoring (ADF tests, outlier detection, condition numbers)
   - Cache mechanism with TTL
   - Preparation methods for optimization with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage

2. **Confidence Scoring Framework** (`shared/confidence_scoring.py`)
   - Comprehensive confidence metrics for all calculation types
   - Component-based scoring (data quality, sample adequacy, model stability)
   - Warning generation for edge cases
   - Standardized response wrapping with confidence metadata

### In Progress ðŸ”„

3. **Week 1: Replace synthetic data in all servers**
   - âœ… Created enhanced risk-mcp-server v2 with data pipeline integration
   - Need to update portfolio-mcp-server to use data_pipeline
   - Need to update servers to include confidence scoring

### Recently Completed âœ…

3. **Risk Server v2** (`risk-mcp-server/risk_mcp_server_v2.py`)
   - Integrated real market data via data_pipeline
   - Added advanced risk measures (Modified VaR, Ulcer Index, Student-t VaR)
   - Fat-tail modeling with distribution testing
   - Confidence scoring on all endpoints
   - Stress testing with historical crisis scenarios
   - Risk parity calculations with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage

4. **Risk Server v3 - Consolidated** (`risk-mcp-server/risk_mcp_server_v3.py`)
   - **MAJOR IMPROVEMENT**: Consolidated from 5 tools to just 2
   - Single `analyze_portfolio_risk` tool provides complete risk analysis
   - One API call returns all risk metrics, VaR, stress tests, and decomposition
   - Reduced latency (data fetched once, not 5 times)
   - Structured hierarchical output with executive summary
   - Customizable via `analysis_options` parameter

### Completed Week 2 Tasks âœ…

5. **Portfolio Server v3 - Professional Grade** (`portfolio-mcp-server/portfolio_mcp_server_v3.py`)
   - Integrated Riskfolio-Lib with 13+ risk measures (CVaR, EVaR, MDR, UCI, etc.)
   - PyPortfolioOpt with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
   - Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) - no matrix inversion needed
   - Black-Litterman model for incorporating market views
   - Discrete allocation to actual shares
   - Single tool handles all optimization methods

### Completed Week 3 Tasks âœ…

6. **Tax Server v2 - Enhanced** (`tax-mcp-server/tax_mcp_server_v2.py`)
   - **NIIT Implementation**: Proper 3.8% surtax with MAGI thresholds
     - Confirmed tenforty does NOT calculate NIIT (via DeepWiki research)
     - Custom implementation with correct thresholds ($200k single, $250k MFJ, $15.2k trust)
   - **Trust Tax Support**: Form 1041 with compressed brackets
     - Trusts hit 37% at $15,200 vs $609,350 for individuals
     - DNI and distribution deduction handling
   - **Massachusetts Specifics**: 
     - 5% flat rate on ordinary income
     - 12% on short-term capital gains (unique to MA)
     - 5% on long-term capital gains
   - Single comprehensive tool: `calculate_comprehensive_tax`

### Pending Items ðŸ“‹

#### Week 4 Tasks (In Progress)
- [ ] Integrate QuantStats for professional analytics
- [x] Add confidence scoring to all server endpoints (90% complete)
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with real market data

## Notes
- Third-party feedback document preserved at ~/investing/feedback.md
- No backward compatibility needed (local prototypes)
- Aggressive refactoring permitted for quality
