      Import portfolio data from CSV files:
      1. Read Vanguard CSV from /mnt/c/Users/hvksh/investing/portfolio/vanguard.csv
      2. Import using mcp__portfolio-state-server__import_broker_csv with broker="vanguard"
      3. Read UBS CSV from /mnt/c/Users/hvksh/investing/portfolio/ubs.csv
      4. Import using mcp__portfolio-state-server__import_broker_csv with broker="ubs"
      Note: Portfolio state server starts empty on each initialization.
