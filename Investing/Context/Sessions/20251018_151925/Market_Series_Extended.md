Data pulled via MCP to deepen October 2025 market context. Proxies used where direct indices are unavailable. No portfolio recommendations; ES gating applies throughout.

  - 10Y–3M (TCM spread): +2 bps (2025-10-17).
- MOVE Index (^MOVE): range ~70–90 since Sep; spikes on 2025-10-10 and 2025-10-16 indicate rates vol upticks.
- Equities:

  - RSP (equal-weight): ~187.1 → ~188.0, marginal; breadth remains narrow vs cap-weight.
  - QQQ: ~565.6 → ~603.9, +6.8% — megacap growth resilient.
  - IWM (small caps): ~233.9 → ~243.4, +~4.1% with elevated volatility.
  - EFA (DM ex-US): ~90.6 → ~94.5, +~4.3%.

- FX/Commodities Proxies:

- Gold (LBMA): ~3,469 (9/1) → ~4,338 (10/17), +~25% safe‑haven bid.

Observations
- Breakevens ~2.3% indicate anchored medium‑term inflation expectations while real yields have eased — supportive of gold.
- Curve de‑inversion progress (10Y–2Y, 10Y–3M ≈ positive) is consistent with slower growth expectations and/or policy normalization path.
- MOVE spikes confirm intermittent rates‑vol stress; equities exhibit similar bursts (VIX > 20 mid‑Oct).
- Credit proxies show limited deterioration; equities breadth remains thin (RSP lag vs SPY).
- Energy softened and copper firmed — unusual pairing; monitor for growth vs supply narratives.
- USD firmer acts as a tightening channel globally.

Risk Gate
- ES(97.5%) must remain < 2.5%. If breached, HALT all trading immediately. This appendix is informational only.
