Objective: Improve downside resilience while preserving core exposures; all changes must keep ES(97.5%) < 2.5%.

Proposed Moves (Initial Sketch):
- Rotate 2–4% from high beta to quality/low-vol/equal-weight.
- Add staged index put spreads into near-term catalysts.
- Increase cash by ~1–3% from trims; ladder short-duration.
- Maintain a modest gold allocation; avoid chasing by staggering entries.
- Prefer IG over HY; keep HY in short-duration sleeves.

Validation Steps:
- Recompute ES after each batch of trades. Abort further deployment if ES ≥ 2.5%.
- Record pre/post risk metrics and expected drawdown improvements.
