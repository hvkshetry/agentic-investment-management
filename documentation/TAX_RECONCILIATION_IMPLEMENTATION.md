# Tax Reconciliation Implementation - Week 4

## Summary
Implemented single-source-of-truth tax reconciliation system that recomputes tax impact on every portfolio revision, ensuring consistency and preventing the -$9,062 vs +$1,982 discrepancy issues.

## Problem Addressed
Critical issue from feedback: Tax calculations were inconsistent between different components:
- Tax server showing -$9,062 liability
- Portfolio optimizer showing +$1,982 gain
- No recomputation on portfolio revisions
- Missing audit trail for tax calculations
- Wash sale rules not enforced

## Solution: Tax Reconciliation System

### Core Components

#### 1. TaxLot Class
Immutable tax lot tracking:
- `symbol`: Security ticker
- `quantity`: Shares in lot
- `purchase_date`: Acquisition date
- `purchase_price`: Price per share
- `cost_basis`: Total cost
- `is_long_term`: Auto-calculated based on 365+ days
- `calculate_gain()`: Computes gain/loss for partial sales

#### 2. TaxArtifact Class
Immutable tax calculation record:
- `artifact_id`: Unique identifier
- `timestamp`: Calculation timestamp (UTC)
- `allocation_id`: Links to portfolio allocation
- `tax_year`: Tax year for calculations
- `positions`: Symbol weights after revision
- `realized_gains`: STCG, LTCG breakdown
- `unrealized_gains`: Current unrealized P&L
- `tax_liability`: Actual tax owed
- `wash_sales`: Detected wash sale violations
- `checksum`: Deterministic hash for verification

#### 3. TaxReconciliation Class
Single source of truth:
- `recompute_tax_on_revision()`: Main calculation entry point
- FIFO lot selection for sales
- Wash sale detection (61-day window)
- Tax liability calculation with NIIT
- Consistency verification
- Audit trail export

### Key Features

#### FIFO Lot Selection
```python
# Sells oldest lots first for tax efficiency
for lot in self.tax_lots[symbol]:  # Sorted by purchase_date
    if remaining_to_sell <= 0:
        break
    sell_from_lot = min(remaining_to_sell, lot.quantity)
    gain_info = lot.calculate_gain(sale_price, sell_from_lot)
```

#### Wash Sale Detection
- Tracks 30 days before + 30 days after sale
- Disallows losses on substantially identical securities
- Adjusts cost basis for disallowed losses

#### Tax Liability Calculation
```python
# 2024 tax rates
stcg_tax = stcg * 0.24  # Ordinary income rate
ltcg_tax = ltcg * 0.15  # Capital gains rate
niit = (stcg + ltcg) * 0.038  # Net Investment Income Tax
total = stcg_tax + ltcg_tax + niit
```

#### Immutable Artifacts
- Checksums prevent tampering
- Complete audit trail maintained
- Retrievable by allocation ID
- Cache system for persistence

### Integration with Round-2 Gate

Tax reconciliation integrates seamlessly with Round-2 gate:

```python
# In Round-2 gate validation
tax_report = reconciler.recompute_tax_on_revision(
    allocation_id=lineage.revision_id,
    current_allocation=current_weights,
    target_allocation=revised_weights,
    portfolio_value=portfolio_value,
    current_prices=market_prices
)

# Verify consistency
is_consistent = (
    set(tax_report.positions.keys()) == set(revised_allocation.keys())
    and tax_report.timestamp > (datetime.now(utc) - timedelta(minutes=5))
)
```

### Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suite validates:
- ✅ Long-term vs short-term classification
- ✅ Gain/loss calculation accuracy
- ✅ Tax recomputation on revision
- ✅ Artifact checksum determinism
- ✅ Consistency verification
- ✅ Wash sale detection
- ✅ FIFO lot selection
- ✅ Multiple revision handling
- ✅ Tax liability calculation
- ✅ Artifact immutability
- ✅ Cache operations
- ✅ Audit trail export
- ✅ Round-2 gate integration

All 13 tests passing.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **tax-mcp-server/tax_reconciliation.py**
   - Complete tax reconciliation implementation
   - 500+ lines of production-ready code

2. **tests/unit/test_tax_reconciliation.py**
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - 13 test cases covering all scenarios
   - Integration test with Round-2 gate

### Critical Improvements

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All tax calculations go through TaxReconciliation
2. **Recomputation on Revision**: Every portfolio change triggers fresh tax calculation
3. **Immutable Artifacts**: Tamper-proof tax records with checksums
4. **Wash Sale Enforcement**: Automatic detection and adjustment
5. **FIFO Compliance**: Proper lot selection for tax efficiency
6. **Complete Audit Trail**: Every calculation traceable
7. **Consistency Verification**: Ensures tax report matches allocation

### Example Usage

```python
reconciler = TaxReconciliation(tax_year=2024)

# Load existing tax lots
reconciler.load_tax_lots(tax_lots_from_portfolio)

# Recompute on portfolio revision
artifact = reconciler.recompute_tax_on_revision(
    allocation_id="alloc_20250818_001",
    current_allocation={"AAPL": 0.40, "MSFT": 0.35, "GOOGL": 0.25},
    target_allocation={"AAPL": 0.30, "MSFT": 0.35, "GOOGL": 0.35},
    portfolio_value=1000000.00,
    current_prices={"AAPL": 180, "MSFT": 400, "GOOGL": 150}
)

print(f"Tax impact: ${artifact.tax_liability['total']:.2f}")
print(f"STCG: ${artifact.realized_gains['short_term']:.2f}")
print(f"LTCG: ${artifact.realized_gains['long_term']:.2f}")
print(f"Artifact ID: {artifact.artifact_id}")
print(f"Checksum: {artifact.checksum}")
```

### Next Steps

1. Integrate with portfolio manager MCP server
2. Connect to live brokerage for actual tax lots
3. Add state tax calculations
4. Implement tax loss harvesting optimizer
5. Create tax report generation for accountants

## Success Metrics

- Zero tax calculation discrepancies
- 100% of revisions have tax artifacts
- Wash sales detected before execution
- Complete audit trail for IRS compliance
- Tax impact calculated within 100ms
