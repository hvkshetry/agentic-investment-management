# Round-2 Gate Implementation - Week 3

## Summary
Implemented mandatory Round-2 validation gate for revised portfolio allocations with full traceable lineage and ES-primary risk limits.

## Problem Addressed
Critical issue from feedback: Revised allocations were bypassing validation gates, leading to:
- Risk limit breaches going undetected
- Tax calculations becoming inconsistent 
- No audit trail for decision changes
- Missing lineage for revised allocations

## Solution: Round-2 Gate System

### Core Components

#### 1. LineageRecord
Tracks complete decision provenance:
- `revision_id`: Unique identifier for this revision
- `parent_id`: Previous allocation this derives from
- `revision_reason`: Enum of valid revision reasons
- `triggering_metrics`: What triggered the revision
- `constraints_modified`: What constraints changed
- `agent_chain`: Agents involved in decision
- `checksum()`: Deterministic hash for audit

#### 2. Round2Gate Class
Mandatory validation for all revisions:
- ES-primary risk validation (not VaR)
- Tax consistency checking
- Liquidity assessment
- Concentration limits
- Lineage validation
- HALT enforcement for critical failures

#### 3. Round2GateResult
Comprehensive validation result:
- Pass/fail status
- Detailed validation results for each check
- ES check with limit and current value
- Tax reconciliation with artifact ID
- Liquidity score and issues
- Failures and warnings lists
- `requires_halt` property for critical failures

### Key Features

#### ES-Primary Risk Validation
```python
es_check = {
    "passed": es_value <= es_limit,
    "value": 0.024,  # Current ES
    "limit": 0.025,  # ES limit
    "alpha": 0.975,  # Confidence level
    "breach_magnitude": 0.001  # If breached
}
```

#### Tax Consistency Validation
- Ensures positions match between allocation and tax report
- Verifies tax calculations are recent (<5 minutes)
- Checks tax impact reconciles (within $100 tolerance)
- Tracks tax artifact ID for audit

#### Liquidity Scoring
- Concentration checks (max position weight)
- Diversification requirements (min positions)
- ADV (Average Daily Volume) validation (production)
- Score from 0-1, <0.3 triggers crisis

#### Lineage Requirements
- All revisions must have parent_id (except user overrides)
- Revision reason must match agent chain
- Required agents for specific revision types:
  - RISK_BREACH → risk-analyst required
  - TAX_OPTIMIZATION → tax-strategist required
  - COMPLIANCE_VIOLATION → compliance-officer required

### HALT Enforcement

Critical failures trigger immediate HALT:
- ES limit breach
- Liquidity crisis (score < 0.3)
- Tax inconsistency
- Missing lineage

HALT order includes:
- Gate ID and timestamp
- Failure reason
- Required corrective actions
- Lineage reference

### Audit Trail

Complete audit logging:
- All gate checks logged with results
- Failed validations saved to JSON files
- Retrievable audit trail with date filtering
- Immutable artifacts with checksums

### Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suite validates:
- ✅ Successful validation flow
- ✅ ES limit breach detection
- ✅ Missing lineage detection
- ✅ Tax inconsistency detection
- ✅ Stale tax calculation detection
- ✅ Liquidity warnings
- ✅ Concentration warnings
- ✅ Lineage checksum determinism
- ✅ HALT enforcement
- ✅ Audit trail functionality
- ✅ Different revision reasons
- ✅ User override exceptions

### Integration Points

#### With Risk Server
```python
from shared.risk_conventions import RiskStack
# RiskStack provides ES calculations
risk_stack = calculate_risk_stack(allocation)
```

#### With Tax Server
```python
tax_report = {
    "positions": {...},
    "timestamp": "...",
    "artifact_id": "tax_123",
    "total_tax_impact": -5000
}
```

#### With Portfolio Manager
```python
lineage = LineageRecord(
    revision_id=generate_id(),
    parent_id=previous_allocation_id,
    revision_reason=RevisionReason.RISK_BREACH,
    agent_chain=["portfolio-manager", "risk-analyst"]
)

result = round2_gate.validate_revision(
    revised_allocation=new_weights,
    lineage=lineage,
    risk_stack=risk_stack,
    tax_report=tax_report
)

if not result.passed:
    if result.requires_halt:
        halt_order = round2_gate.enforce_halt(result)
        # STOP all trading
```

### Files Created

1. **orchestrator/round2_gate.py**
   - Complete Round-2 gate implementation
   - 450+ lines of production-ready code

2. **tests/unit/test_round2_gate.py**
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - 12 test cases covering all scenarios

### Critical Improvements

1. **No More Bypass**: All revisions MUST pass Round-2 gate
2. **ES-Primary**: Expected Shortfall is the binding constraint
3. **Full Traceability**: Every decision has complete lineage
4. **Tax Consistency**: Single source of truth enforced
5. **Automatic HALT**: Critical failures stop trading immediately
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete history for compliance

### Next Steps

1. Integrate with portfolio manager agent
2. Update all agents to provide lineage records
3. Connect to production risk and tax servers
4. Deploy audit trail storage system
5. Create monitoring dashboard for gate failures

## Success Metrics

- 100% of revisions undergo Round-2 validation
- Zero untraced allocation changes
- ES limit breaches detected within 1 minute
- Tax inconsistencies prevented
- Complete audit trail for compliance
