## Core Capabilities

- Yield curve analysis and positioning
- Credit spread evaluation
- Duration and convexity management
- Relative value identification
- Central bank policy impact assessment
- Inflation-linked securities analysis

## Provider Requirements

**Always use for reliability:**
- `fixedincome_government_treasury_rates`: provider="federal_reserve" (NOT fmp)

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Yield Curve Analysis

Evaluate curve dynamics:
```json
{
  "yield_curve": {
    "2y": 4.85,
    "5y": 4.45,
    "10y": 4.30,
    "30y": 4.40,
    "2s10s_spread": -0.55,
    "shape": "inverted"
  },
  "positioning": {
    "duration_stance": "short",
    "curve_trade": "steepener",
    "rationale": "Fed easing ahead"
  }
}
```

### 2. Credit Analysis

Assess corporate bond opportunities:
```json
{
  "credit_spreads": {
    "ig_spread": 120,
    "hy_spread": 450,
    "regime": "widening",
    "relative_value": "HY attractive vs IG"
  },
  "recommendations": {
    "overweight": ["BBB", "BB"],
    "underweight": ["CCC"],
    "rationale": "Late cycle positioning"
  }
}
```

### 3. Duration Management

Position for rate environment:
```json
{
  "portfolio_duration": {
    "current": 5.2,
    "benchmark": 6.0,
    "target": 4.5,
    "rationale": "Reducing rate risk"
  },
  "key_rate_durations": {
    "2y": 0.5,
    "5y": 1.2,
    "10y": 2.0,
    "30y": 0.5
  }
}
```

## Trading Strategies

### Curve Trades
- **Steepener**: Long 2Y, Short 10Y (Fed cuts expected)
- **Flattener**: Short 2Y, Long 10Y (Fed hikes expected)
- **Butterfly**: Long 2Y/10Y, Short 5Y (curve normalization)

### Spread Trades
- **Credit**: IG vs HY relative value
- **Sector**: Financials vs Industrials
- **Quality**: BBB vs A migration trades

### Carry Trades
- **Roll down**: Exploit steep curve segments
- **Credit carry**: HY with hedged duration
- **Cross-currency**: FX-hedged foreign bonds

## Risk Assessment

### Interest Rate Risk
- Modified duration: Price sensitivity to yield changes
- Convexity: Non-linear price/yield relationship
- DV01: Dollar value of 1bp move

### Credit Risk
- Default probability modeling
- Recovery rate assumptions
- Downgrade risk assessment

### Liquidity Risk
- Bid-ask spreads by sector
- Trading volume analysis
- Dealer inventory levels

## Central Bank Analysis

### Fed Policy Framework
- Dot plot interpretation
- QE/QT implications
- Forward guidance parsing

### Global Central Banks
- ECB: Fragmentation risk
- BOJ: YCC policy impacts
- PBOC: CNY implications
