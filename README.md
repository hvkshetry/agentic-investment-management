# AI Investment Management Team

A sophisticated investment analysis platform combining MCP servers with Claude Code's agent orchestration system to deliver institutional-grade portfolio management, risk analysis, and tax optimization.

## üè¶ System Overview

This platform functions as an AI-powered investment management team, with specialized agents working together through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to provide comprehensive financial analysis and portfolio management.

## üöÄ Claude Code Configuration

### Prerequisites
1. Install Claude Code CLI
2. Clone this repository to WSL (Ubuntu recommended)
3. Set up Python environment with dependencies

### MCP Server Configuration

Create or update `~/.claude/settings.json` (Windows: `C:\Users\[username]\.claude\settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openbb-curated": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "-d", "Ubuntu",
        "/home/[username]/investing/openbb/bin/openbb-mcp",
        "--transport", "stdio",
        "--no-tool-discovery"
      ]
    },
    "tax-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "-d", "Ubuntu",
        "/home/[username]/investing/openbb/bin/python",
        "/home/[username]/investing/tax-mcp-server/tax_mcp_server_v2.py"
      ]
    },
    "portfolio-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "-d", "Ubuntu",
        "/home/[username]/investing/openbb/bin/python",
        "/home/[username]/investing/portfolio-mcp-server/portfolio_mcp_server_v3.py"
      ]
    },
    "risk-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "wsl",
      "args": [
        "-d", "Ubuntu",
        "/home/[username]/investing/openbb/bin/python",
        "/home/[username]/investing/risk-mcp-server/risk_mcp_server_v3.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent Configuration

1. Copy agent prompts to your project:
```bash
cp agent-prompts/CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/CLAUDE.md
cp -r agent-prompts/sub-agents /path/to/your/project/.claude/agents/
```

2. The agents will automatically coordinate through the main orchestrator when you work on investment tasks.

### API Keys Setup

Create `~/.openbb_platform/user_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "fred_api_key": "your_fred_key",
    "bls_api_key": "your_bls_key",
    "fmp_api_key": "your_fmp_key"
  }
}
```

## üíº Usage Examples

### Comprehensive Portfolio Rebalancing
"I have saved my current portfolio holdings (statements including cost basis) as CSV files. Given the macro environment, Fed pivot expectations, and current valuations, what do you recommend as prudent reallocation moves? Also, what low risk/high upside asymmetric 'bets' are available that - given your analysis - present a compelling expected value?"

### Tax-Optimized Exit Strategy
"I need to liquidate $500k from my portfolio for a real estate purchase. Analyze my holdings for tax-loss harvesting opportunities, calculate the optimal assets to sell considering STCG vs LTCG implications, NIIT thresholds, and state tax impacts. Also evaluate if establishing a trust structure would provide benefits given my $350k W2 income."

### Multi-Strategy Risk Analysis
"Perform a comprehensive risk assessment across my equity portfolio, fixed income allocation, and options positions. Include stress tests for: 1) 2008-style financial crisis, 2) 1970s stagflation scenario, 3) Japan-style deflation. Calculate my portfolio's factor exposures, identify hidden correlations, and suggest hedging strategies using options that maintain upside participation."

### Institutional-Grade Research Request
"Conduct a full investment committee-style analysis on the semiconductor sector. Include: macro drivers, supply chain dynamics, geopolitical risks (China/Taiwan), competitive positioning of major players, valuation metrics vs historical ranges, options flow analysis for institutional positioning, and specific ETF/equity recommendations with position sizing based on risk parity principles."
