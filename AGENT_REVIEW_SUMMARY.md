## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths

1. **Tool Lists Accurate**: All agent tool lists match their actual capabilities
2. **PolicyEngine-US Integration**: Successfully implemented and documented
3. **No Legacy References**: All "tenforty" references removed from agent prompts
4. **ES-Primary Framework**: Consistently documented across risk/portfolio/tax agents
5. **Tool-First Data Policy**: Implemented across all agents
6. **Two-Stage Policy Events**: Well-documented pattern with known data issues
7. **Parameter Type Warnings**: Present in all agents to prevent MCP call failures

### ⚠️ Issues Found

1. **Tax-Server Configuration** (Priority 1):
   - Server exists: `/home/hvksh/investing/tax-mcp-server/tax_mcp_server_v2.py`
   - Tool implemented: `calculate_comprehensive_tax`
   - But NOT in `.mcp.json` (not enabled)
   - **Decision needed**: Enable or remove from agent tool lists

2. **CLAUDE.md Outdated Workflow** (Priority 2):
   - Contains detailed 5-step workflow that should be in slash commands
   - Should reference `.claude/commands/` instead
   - Agent table incomplete (only lists 5 of 12 agents)

3. **Minor Documentation** (Priority 3):
   - Legacy references to "tenforty" in code comments (acceptable)
   - Old test results reference "tenforty" (archival, no action needed)

## MCP Server Status

### Currently Enabled ✅
- portfolio-state-server
- portfolio-optimization-server
- risk-server
- tax-optimization-server
- openbb-curated
- policy-events-service
- sequential-thinking
- obsidian (for Claude Code)
- deepwiki
- codex
- excel-mcp-server

### Implemented But Not Enabled ⚠️
- **tax-mcp-server** (tax-server)
  - File exists and functional
  - Uses PolicyEngine-US (AGPL-3.0)
  - Referenced in agent tool lists
  - NOT in `.mcp.json`

---

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1 (Critical) - DONE ✅
1. ~~Fix tax-advisor.md line 138~~ - **ALREADY FIXED**
   - No "tenforty" references found in agent prompts
   - Code comments are acceptable

### Priority 1 (Critical) - NEEDS DECISION
2. **Resolve tax-server configuration**:
   - Option A: Add `tax-mcp-server` to `.mcp.json` if needed
   - Option B: Remove `mcp__tax-server__calculate_comprehensive_tax` from agent tool lists
   - Current workaround: Tax functionality available via tax-optimization-server

### Priority 2 (Important)
3. **Update CLAUDE.md**:
   - Remove detailed workflow steps (lines 61-223)
   - Add reference to `.claude/commands/` for implementations
   - Point to `WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full documentation
   - Expand or reference agent catalog

## Git History Relevant Commits

```
2700a4f feat: Add SEC filing section parser using edgar-crawler
ebf7569 feat: Replace tenforty with PolicyEngine-US for individual tax calculations
efbb6ef Update all agents with policy event guidance and Congress.gov API limitations
9d986f6 Redesign policy-events-mcp-server with two-stage sieve pattern
```

**Key Insight**: The "tenforty → PolicyEngine-US" migration was completed in commit `ebf7569`, and all agent prompts were updated. No cleanup needed in agent definition files.

---

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. Decide on tax-server configuration (enable or remove references)
2. Update CLAUDE.md to remove outdated workflow example
3. Consider creating agent collaboration cookbook

### Long Term
1. Create agent capability matrix (agents × tools)
2. Document common agent collaboration patterns
3. Add agent selection flowchart for user requests
4. Consider agent orchestration automation

---

## Conclusion

**Agent definitions are WELL-MAINTAINED and ACCURATE.**

The specialized agents correctly reference:
- ✅ Current tools (PolicyEngine-US, not tenforty)
- ✅ Proper parameter types (native Python, not JSON strings)
- ✅ ES-primary risk framework
- ✅ Tool-First Data Policy
- ✅ Two-stage policy event monitoring

**Only critical issue**: Tax-server configuration ambiguity (exists but not enabled).

**Overall Grade**: A- (would be A with tax-server decision made)
